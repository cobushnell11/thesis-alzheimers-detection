# Unveiling Key Features: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Alzheimer's Detection
## Paper and Code

This repository is made public to share my master's thesis and the code involved, wherein I explore the ability of machine learning models to detect dementia in Alzheimer's screening patients. There is a small issue with the size of the section 2 notebook due to the output stored from the LimeTextExplainer. However, to view the section 2 notebook, it is as simple as downloading and opening yourself or following this link to [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org/github/cobushnell11/thesis-alzheimers-detection/blob/main/Thesis_Section_2.ipynb).

### Abstract

This thesis rigorously evaluates the application of an array of natural language processing
(NLP) techniques and machine learning models to identify linguistic signatures indicative of
dementia, as sourced from the DementiaBank Pitt corpus. Utilizing a binary classification
paradigm, this study meticulously integrates sophisticated embedding methods—including
Doc2Vec, Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT—with traditional machine learning algorithms such as
Random Forest, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, ADA boost, KNN classifier, and Logistic Regression,
alongside deep learning architectures like LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. The efficacy of
these methodologies is evaluated based on their capacity to differentiate between transcribed
speech impacted by dementia and that from control subjects. To enhance interpretability, this
research also employs feature importance analysis through LIME, SHAP, permutation
importance, and integrated gradients, shedding light on the variables most instrumental in driving
model predictions. The results of this comprehensive analysis not only illuminate the robust
potential of these combined NLP and machine learning approaches in the context of medical
screening but also contribute additional valuable insights to the field of NLP and dementia
screening specifically.
